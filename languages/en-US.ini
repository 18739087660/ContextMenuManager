AboutApp = [Main function]\n 1. Manage common location context menu\n 2. Customize and add context menu\n\n[Compatibility]\n 1. Suitable for Win7, 8, 8.1, 10, Vista\n 2. Suitable For x64, x32 CPU operating system\n 3. Adapt to high resolution screens, the best zoom ratio is 150%\n\n[Open source code]\n 1. Code language: C#, Winform program\n 2. GitHub project: https://github.com/BluePointLilac/ContextMenuManager\n 3. Gitee project: https://gitee.com/BluePointLilac/ContextMenuManager\n\n[Contact Author]\n 1. The program is developed by myself, yet I of course also want to thank Meng Yanshe @ Kengchen for answering questions in normal times, since my ability for this is limited.\n There are inevitably some bugs, and everyone is welcome to leave feedback and make suggestions\n 2. Personal B station: https://space.bilibili.com/34492771 (I welcome everyone to follow me!)\n 3. QQ mailbox: 1617859183@qq.com\n\n[Resource Reference]\n 1. The main program icon comes from: https://www.easyicon.net/1208132-mouse_icon.html\n 2. Program button icons are mainly from the Alibaba vector icon library: https://www.iconfont.cn/\n 3. WinX HashLnk (Rafael Rivera): https://github.com/riverar/hashlnk\n\n[Program update]\n 1. The program has a check and update function. In addition to updating the program itself, it also updates the dictionary. After the download is complete, you can directly overwrite the original file.\n 2. Because GitHub Raw is walled and Gitee Raw has a monthly access limit, the program is set to check for updates once a month.\n You can also browse the GitHub Releases column or the Gitee release column to check if there are updates\n\n[Warm Tips]\n 1. Some special menu items may be affected by other factors, they will not be displayed in the context menu.\n However, they will still be displayed as enabled in this program according to the general rules used by the program. This is normal.\n 2. The method of disabling the menu for each context menu management program may be different. It is recommended not to use multiple context menu management programs at the same time.\n Most programs use a simple and violent backup-delete method. This program uses the key values ​​provided by the system to hide operations as much as possible.\n If you have used other programs to disable the menu item before, please use the corresponding program to restore it, otherwise you may not be able to see it in this program.\n 3. This program is not used to clean up programs that have not been uninstalled, but it can help you locate the registry and file locations of the menu items.\n You can perform your operations according to the relevant content. If you are a computer novice, you are recommended to only touch the enable\disable switch.
