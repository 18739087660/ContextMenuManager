Suitable For 64bit, 32bit CPU operating system \r\n 3. Adapt to high resolution screens, the best zoom ratio is 150% \r\n\r\n [Open source code] \r\n  1.

Gitee project: https://gitee.com/BluePointLilac/ContextMenuManager \r\n\r\n [Warm Tips] \r\n 1. Some special menu items may be affected by other factors, they will not be displayed in the context menu. \r\n However, they will still be displayed as enabled in this program according to the general rules used by the program. This is normal. \r\n 2. The method of disabling the menu for each context menu management program may be different. It is recommended not to use multiple context menu management programs at the same time. \r\n Most programs use a simple and violent backup-delete method. This program uses the key values ​​provided by the system to hide operations as much as possible. \r\n If you have used other programs to disable the menu item before, please use the corresponding program to restore it, otherwise you may not be able to see it in this program. \r\n 3. This program is not used to clean up programs that have not been uninstalled, but it can help you locate the registry and file locations of the menu items. \r\n You can perform your operations according to the relevant content. If you are a computer novice, you are recommended to only touch the enable\disable switch.
